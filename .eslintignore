node_modules
# In addition to any patterns in the .eslintignore file, ESLint always follows a couple of implicit ignore rules even if the --no-ignore flag is passed. The implicit rules are as follows:
# · node_modules/ is ignored.
# · dot-files (except for .eslintrc.*), as well as dot-folders and their contents, are ignored.
